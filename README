NAME
    Sub::Timekeeper - calls a function with a stopwatch

SYNOPSIS
        use Sub::Timekeeper qw(timekeeper);

        my $val = timekeeper(my $elapsed, sub {
            ...
            return $retval;
        });

        my @arr = timekeeper(my $elapsed, sub {
            ...
            return @retarr;
        });

DESCRIPTION
    The module exports the "timekeeper" function, that can be used to
    measure the time spent to execute a function. The duration is set to the
    first argument in seconds (as a floating point value).

    The duration is set regardless of whether the called function returned
    normally or by an exception. In other words the following snippet will
    report the correct duration.

        my $elapsed;
        eval {
            timekeeper($elapsed, sub {
                ...
            }
        };
        if ($@) {
            warn "got error $@ after $elapsed seconds";
        }
